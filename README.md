# Practice-Projects
here I will create mini projects for practice

## problem 1
### Create a program that demonstrates the use of let, var, and const to declare variables and shows their behavior. The program should also include examples of different JavaScript data types like string, number, boolean, array, and object. 
### Declare a const variable to store your name as a string.
### Use let to declare a variable to hold your age, and later update it to simulate a birthday.
### Use var to declare a variable for a boolean value to indicate if you're a student.
### Create an array of your favorite colors.
### Create an object to store your hobbies with their respective time spent in hours.
```
const fullName = "mehmood sultan"
let age = 28
age = 1996
var is_fullName_student = true
let myFavColors = ['green', 'yellow', 'red', 'blue']
const myHobbies = {
    morning: 'go for a walk',
    afternoon: 'lunch',
    evening: 'football',
    night: 'coding'
}
console.table([fullName,age,is_fullName_student,myFavColors,myHobbies])
```
